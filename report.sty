\end{center}
\section{Overview}
    \subsection{\textbf{\textit{General information about the topic}}}
    Within the scope of the course, the following 05 topics are proposed:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item[-] \underline{Topic 1:} Learning/Teaching
        \item[-] \underline{Topic 2:} Multiple-choice Questions and Exams
        \item[-] \underline{Topic 3:} Hospital
        \item[-] \underline{Topic 4:} E-Bookstore
        \item[-] \underline{Topic 5:} Publication
    \end{itemize}
Each topic has a mandatory business description and is required to develop an application program to support these operations. Additional operations and binding details may be proposed during the implementation of the topic.\\
\\
Each topic supports data requirements for students to practice conceptual design and then proceed to logical design and specific implementation on a database management system (DBMS). The development of a complete application on the selected DBMS is also required for each topic. Therefore, each topic is divided into 2 parts:
\begin{itemize}
    \item[-] \underline{Part 1 (\textbf{\textit{Assignment \# 1}}):} Conceptual design, logical design, database implementation on a DBMS, and learning and using technology to develop applications on the selected DBMS.
    \item[-] \underline{Part 2 (\textbf{\textit{Assignment \# 2}}):} Complete the database by achieving database schema normalization and database security, and develop an application program with the completed database on a DBMS.
\end{itemize}

The contents carried out for each topic are aligned with the course learning outcomes as described in the course syllabus.
    \subsection{\textbf{\textit{Guidelines for implementing the topic:}}}
Each topic is carried out by \textbf{a group of no more than 4 members}. Members and topics for each group are assigned \textbf{randomly} by the instructor.\\
    \\
Sample data for illustration in each topic is prepared by each group, ensuring that the described constraints are met. The contents that need to be implemented are detailed for each topic. Each group is responsible for its own task assignments.\\
\\
Note that group activities are recorded in the practical assessment and group reports.

    \subsection{\textbf{\textit{Evaluation}}}
        \begin{enumerate}[A]
            \item \underline{Requirements for Assignment \#1:}
                \begin{enumerate}[1]
                    \item List the strong entity types and the linking relationship types.
                    \item List the weak entity types and the corresponding strong entity types that define the relationships.
                    \item Identify the key attributes and their descriptions for entities and relationships types.
                    \item Identify constraints.
                    \item (BONUS) Expand the data request (e.g., security, etc.).
                    \item Sketch a diagram of entities and relationships.
                    \item Mapping the entity-relationship schema to a relational database schema, along with specific definitions of the constraints.
                    \item Choose and install a DBMS (Oracle, MS SQL Server, MySQL, PostgreSQL, etc.).
                    \item Define the relational database schema on the chosen and installed DBMS. Define user groups, the corresponding permissions for each group, and implement them on the DBMS.
                    \item Write SQL statements.
                    \item Prepare the technology for developing the database application (Front-end/Back-end).
                    \item Prepare the report and presentation.
                \end{enumerate}
            \item \underline{Requirements for Assignment \#2:}
                \begin{enumerate}[1]
                    \item Write Functions/Procedures/Assertions/Triggers.
                    \item Define user groups and assign permissions at the application level.
                    \item Define the architecture for the application.
                    \item (BONUS) Detailed design for the application.
                    \item Normalize the schema to BCNF form for the database schema.
                    \item (BONUS) Compare the data in the database with the data in files such as text files when developing the application for the assignment, illustrating the update of data related to semantic constraints in the topic: (1) The database is checked for consistency with the constraints implemented in the DBMS, (2) The files are checked for consistency with the constraints implemented in the application program.
                    \item  (BONUS) Implement indexing => illustrate measuring and comparing execution time with large demo data: (1) query without indexing, (2) query with indexing.
                    \item Develop a complete application.
                    \item Prepare the report.
                \end{enumerate}

Groups need to prepare as they will be working on group assignments, but during the presentation in the classroom, any member or any member of the group may be assigned to present the report. \textit{A quick quiz in the classroom} will also be conducted for these sections.
                            \item[-] \textbf{Summary report:}
                                \begin{itemize}

    \subsection{\textbf{\textit{Disclaimer notes:}}}
The processes described in the topics are to be used solely within the scope of the course and do not involve or utilize any private data of any entity or individual.\\
\\
The evaluation for Assignment \#1 and Assignment \#2 is planned but may be applied flexibly for different classes depending on the actual circumstances in each class.\\
\\
The assignment files must be submitted on BKEL. Therefore, groups should pay attention to the submission deadlines to ensure there are no risks associated with the files they have submitted, as BKEL automatically closes the submission page. Late submissions are not accepted. Submitting assignments via email is also not accepted.
